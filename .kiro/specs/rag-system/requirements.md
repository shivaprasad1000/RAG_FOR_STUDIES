# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Study Assistant RAG system designed specifically for exam preparation and academic learning. The system enables students to upload PDF textbooks and notes, extract key information, and query their study materials using natural language to get contextual answers for better understanding and retention.

## Glossary

- **Study_Assistant**: The complete RAG application for academic learning
- **PDF_Processor**: The component that extracts text and structure from PDF documents
- **Knowledge_Base**: The searchable database containing processed study materials
- **Vector_Store**: Simple vector database for storing text embeddings
- **Embedding_Generator**: Service that converts text chunks into searchable vectors
- **Query_Engine**: Component that finds relevant study material based on questions
- **Answer_Generator**: Service that creates study-focused responses using retrieved content
- **Study_Interface**: Web interface for uploading materials and asking study questions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to upload PDF textbooks and notes, so that I can create a searchable study database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student uploads a file, THE Study_Assistant SHALL accept PDF format documents only
2. WHEN a PDF is uploaded, THE PDF_Processor SHALL extract text content and preserve basic structure
3. WHEN text extraction is complete, THE PDF_Processor SHALL split content into logical chunks of 800 characters with 100 character overlap
4. WHEN chunks are created, THE Embedding_Generator SHALL create vector embeddings for each chunk
5. IF a PDF upload fails, THEN THE Study_Assistant SHALL display a clear error message with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to ask questions about my study materials, so that I can get quick answers and explanations for exam preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student submits a study question, THE Study_Interface SHALL accept natural language queries
2. WHEN a question is received, THE Query_Engine SHALL find the 3 most relevant text chunks from uploaded materials
3. WHEN relevant content is found, THE Answer_Generator SHALL create a study-focused response using the retrieved context
4. WHEN an answer is generated, THE Study_Interface SHALL display the response with source page references
5. THE Study_Assistant SHALL highlight key concepts and definitions in the response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to organize my study materials, so that I can manage different subjects and topics effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Study_Assistant SHALL display all uploaded PDFs with filename and upload date
2. WHEN a student selects a document, THE Study_Assistant SHALL show document details and page count
3. WHEN a student deletes a document, THE Study_Assistant SHALL remove all associated content from the Knowledge_Base
4. THE Study_Assistant SHALL allow students to add tags or subjects to organize documents
5. THE Study_Assistant SHALL support searching documents by filename or tags

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want fast and accurate study assistance, so that I can efficiently prepare for exams without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a study question is asked, THE Query_Engine SHALL return relevant content within 3 seconds
2. WHEN generating study answers, THE Answer_Generator SHALL complete responses within 8 seconds
3. THE Study_Assistant SHALL provide accurate answers for at least 85% of questions related to uploaded content
4. WHEN multiple relevant sections exist, THE Answer_Generator SHALL synthesize information from different parts of the materials
5. THE Study_Assistant SHALL handle up to 5 concurrent study sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to customize my study experience, so that I can optimize the system for my learning style and subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Study_Assistant SHALL allow adjustment of answer detail level (brief, detailed, comprehensive)
2. THE Study_Assistant SHALL support different response styles (explanatory, bullet points, examples)
3. THE Study_Assistant SHALL allow configuration of how many source chunks to use (2-5)
4. WHERE study preferences are set, THE Study_Assistant SHALL remember settings for future sessions
5. THE Study_Assistant SHALL provide options to focus on definitions, examples, or conceptual explanations
